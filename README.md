- **Format:** CSV  
- **Attributes:** Timestamp, Latitude, Longitude, HCHO Concentration (mol/m²), Region

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels  
- **Visualization Tools:** Streamlit, Power BI  
- **Forecasting Model:** ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 📊 Key Features

- HCHO concentration heatmaps across Sri Lanka  
- Interactive filtering by region and date  
- Trend analysis with line plots and ARIMA-based forecasts  
- Streamlit-based dashboard hosted on cloud using AWS EC2
- Power BI dashboard for high-level reporting and stakeholder communication
